Achieving 70%+ accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset..
Experimenting with switching Batch, Layer, Group normalization.
I was able to cross the target accuracy with limited image augmentations and 58k model parameters.
I need to figure out how to plot misclassified images and make the model modular by breaking into blocks.
